                <h3>Humans: You are the weakest link, Goodbye!</h3>
                <h4>social engineering, phishing, smishing</h4>
                <p>One of the main reasons technology can be flawed is because people are flawed. Computers are machines meant to work perfectly when given a set of commands. However, because humans are unpredictable, technology can also be unpredictable or programmed incorrectly. This is what makes social engineering attacks (like phishing, smishing, and honeypot) such common cyber attacks. Most of us have heard of the Nigerian Prince email asking anyone who will listen to send their banking information in exchange for lots and lots of money. Spoiler Alert: It doesn ^`^yt happen. According to a CNBC article posted in 2019 $

                <h3>Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption: The Less Keys the Better?</h3>
                <h4>cryptography, encryption, symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, rsa encryption</h4>
                <p>When you ^`^yre talking about keeping your data safe in transit and at rest, the safest way of protecting it is keeping it encrypted. Encryption is the process of converting data known as plaintext into encrypted data known as ciphertext which is nearly impossible to decrypt without knowing the  ^`^|key ^`^}. You can think of encryption like a function. The input is the data that anyone can read. The output is a jumble of letters and numbers that make no sense to the reader. The only way of decrypting the secret message is by knowing the decryption key. This is like a function whose inverse is impossible $
